# Technologies used in **GobstonesWeb2**

We make use of many different technologies and use several platforms in order to develop **GobstonesWeb2**. If you're planning on contributing to the platform with code, or you want to understand better how the different projects work, you should definitely read all the sections below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technologies we use

First you will need to get a grasp of all the different technologies we are using in the development of our modules. Being aware of all the technologies we use will allow you to understand what every configuration file in the project does, and why is it there. Some technologies, like `TypeScript`, that we use as the main programming language, are mandatory for you to learn, while for others is just enough for you to be aware of their existence, as it's not likely that you will have to directly use them or modify the default configurations.

Be sure to read the technology list before starting the contribution in any project by reading the [List of Technologies](./technology-list).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Services we use

Developing a full open source project like **GobstonesWeb2** requires not only technologies, but also services that allow the team to be in touch, share the code, perform code reviews, manage issues, publish artifacts and more.
We make heavy use of third party services in order to achieve that, mainly through the **GitHub** ecosystem.

You may read a detailed list of all the services we use and how in the [List of Services](./services-list).

## Environment setup for newcomers

If it's your first time developing web applications in a `Node.js` platform, using `Git`, or have any doubts on how to get started, we are here to offer some help setting up your environment and getting you started.

We have developed an [Environment Setup](./environment-setup) for you to follow and have everything up and running to start coding in any **GobstonesWeb2** repository.

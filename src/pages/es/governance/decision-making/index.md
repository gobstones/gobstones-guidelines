The **Core Team** is actively engaged in completing an MVP, and holds regular meetings regarding the development of the project every thursday. These meeting are currently not open to the community, but we might held open meetings in the future.

## Project advisors

**GobstonesWeb2** is an open source project aimed at providing a new version of the current environment, with a solid architecture that is understandable, maintainable, and extensible.

In the search for implementing the bet possible policies there is also a list of close advisors on whom we trust, that sometimes are also involved in making decisions. They are:

* Gonzalo Pablo --Perla-- Fernández Florio, [github.com/gpfernandezflorio](https://github.com/gpfernandezflorio)
* Leonardo Marina, [github.com/leomarinag](https://github.com/leomarinag)
* Federico A. Sawady O'Connor, [github.com/sawady](https://github.com/sawady)
* Federico Aloi, [github.com/faloi](https://github.com/faloi)
* Pablo Barenbaum, [github.com/foones](https://github.com/foones)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project community

The **Gobstones** project was born at the National University of Quilmes, at Argentina, and has now expanded to other universities in the country, high-schools and even international institutions. Researchers, developers, and students, from all those institution conform what we call the **Gobstones Community**.

We constantly seek comments and feedback from the community in order to improve, and we consider the members of the community as the major stakeholder of the project.

The community is not exclusive, anyone interested in **Gobstones** can join the community, and participate. You can see how to join the community at the [Communication Section](../communication)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future plans

Currently the project is open, but we remain a little closed. In the future we expect to be able to have open meetings with the project roadmap on discussion, where all the community can join to hare their ideas and vision, and make a more rich exchange.

Also, we would like to have a formal committee that meets regularly to take the decision, and let the decision making not be only part of the core team's decisions.

We are still learning and working hard to improve the **Gobstones Open Source Community**. Please share any comments as to how we can improve, they will be greatly appreciated.

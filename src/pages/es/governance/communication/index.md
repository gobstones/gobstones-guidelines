# Communication

Depending on the needs and on what do you want to communicate, we have different contact channels.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Gobstones Community Server

If you want to join other users to exchange comments, information and experiences, you should join the [**Gobstones Community**](http://bit.ly/ComunidadGobstones) server at [Discord](https://discord.com).

Be sure to [Create a Discord Account](https://discord.com/register) if you don't have one already, link it to your cell phone and protect it, and then join the server.

This is **the** place to be if you are into **Gobstones**. Also, if you want to talk directly to the development team, you may join the community server, as the team usually hangs there.

The language spoken in the server is mostly spanish, yet all nationalities and languages are welcome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## GitHub's Organization Page

If you want to report bugs or issues, you should go to the [GitHub's Organization Page](https://github.com/gobstones).

You should report them in the appropriate repository, so it would be nice if you are aware of the [Project's Architecture](../../architecture) in order to do that.

Issues at GitHub is the main way in which we communicate about the project's development and problems with the software. If you are looking to contribute with code, you should start there.

## Core

The Core Team holds meetings virtually every thursday through Discord itself.

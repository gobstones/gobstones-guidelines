# Governance

Welcome to the first step in contributing the Gobstones organization.
The first thing you need to know in order to collaborate is how and by who the project is governed, and the second is how to keep in touch with the latest news and to get in touch with the core team.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Making

There is a lot of people working in and with **Gobstones**. There are researchers, developers, teachers and students from different places of the world, that contribute in different ways.

Project governance provides direction and defines decision making in all aspects of the **Gobstones Project**, including the language itself, the didactics, and the development environments.

These decisions and the main development of the project is managed by a **Core Team** deciding all the major aspects of the **Gobstones Project** including the development of **GobstonesWeb2**.

You can read more about the decision making project and get to know the members of the current **Core Team** at the [Decision Making Section](./decision-making).

## Communication

Flow of communication guarantees that all contributors are aware of the latest decisions in the project that may affect them. Depending on the needs and on what do you want to communicate, we have different contact channels.

You can read more about how to communicate with the team depending in your needs at the [Communication Section](./communication).

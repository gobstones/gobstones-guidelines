# Coding standards and workflow for **GobstonesWeb2**

If you are going to start developing code you need to understand how projects are organized, how to push code, and what coding standards we use. If you are joining the **Core Team**, or are planning to collaborate as an external developer, you should be sure to understand this section fully.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Organization

You should first understand how our projects are organized, what files are there, what are they for and how we organize different files in folders.

Be sure to read the [**Project Organization Section**](./project-organization) before starting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Styling

No guideline is complete without a proper way to explain how the names of files, variables, classes and others is chosen.

Please be sure to read the [**Code Styling Section**](./code-styling) before going any further.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Submission Workflow

You now understand how projects are organized and how the code should be styled great, now what? How do I contribute by adding new features or correcting bugs? How do I submit code?

The first step is to get acquainted with the workflow we use to manage our code. Be sure to read the [**Commit Conventions Section**](./commit-conventions).

Then, you can see detailed instruction on how to contribute by getting assigned to a task, and producing code. Read the [**Submission Workflow Section**](./submission-workflow) to know more about it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Testing

No contribution or work can be really finished without proper testing. We use **Jest** to test our code, but we have a special way of writing tests altogether. Please be sure to read the [**Testing Ssection**](./testing) in order to understand how we structure our tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation

And of course, if you contribute new code, it has to be documented properly. Please read the [**Writing Documentation Section**](./writing-documentation) and be sure to properly document everything before sending any pull request.

# Introduction to the **GobstonesWeb2** guidelines

The Gobstones-guidelines contain documentation on the platform architecture, design guidelines, ways to contribute, and standards used, related to the development of **GobstonesWeb2**.

There are 4 main sections on the guidelines. Depending on the way you are planning to contribute, you may need to get acquainted only some of them, or you may need to deeply know them all.

The sections are the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Governance

To contribute to any project you should know how the project is managed, who are the members involved and their roles, and how the team and contributors communicate between each other

If you want to contribute in any way, even if it's not coding, you should be aware of everything in this section. So be sure to read the [Governance Section](../governance) so you can learn how do we work, who are we and how to get in touch with us.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Architecture

The architecture of **GobstonesWeb2** combines several modules providing different functionalities, each module in it's own repository, and with different technologies.

If you are planning on getting deeper into how **GobstonesWeb2** works, and which are the major parts of the system, you should read the [Architecture Section](../architecture) to know more about all the modules and how they interrelate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technologies

**GobstonesWeb2** is developed in `Typescript` and we use `Node.js` to develop, along several other technologies associated with those.

If you want to contribute with code in any way, or are planning on downloading and running any of the modules on your own, you should read the [Technologies Section](../technologies) to learn about the technologies we use and how to use them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding

We organize our projects in a particular way, we follow a series of standards when coding and naming elements, document the code or write tests, and we expect participation of contributors in a particular way that you should be aware of.

If you want to contribute with code in any way, please note that we do not accept code that does not follow the standards and workflows explained in this section. So be sure to read the [Coding Section](../coding) to learn about how do we code.

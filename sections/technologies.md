# Technologies used in **GobstonesWeb2**

**GobstonesWeb2** is based on `Node.js`, and `Typescript`, and several technologies associated with those.

## The basics
<details><summary>In order to contribute to the development, you need to have <code>Node.js</code> and some package manager installed in your system, and understand how to use it with a given repository.
</summary><p>
If you want to know more on `Node.js` there are a lot of good books and tutorials on it. 
A good starting point to know the basics on `Node.js` is [`nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
</p></details>

<details><summary>Associated with <code>Node.js</code> you will be using some package manager, to help you download, install, and administer all the packages needed for effective development.
The most common package managers is <code>npm</code> (Node Package Manager), installed together with <code>Node.js</code>, but there are others.
</summary><p>
A good starting point to know the basics on `npm` is [`npmjs.com`](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm).
</p></details>

<details><summary>Finally, we use <code>Typescript</code> for most of the development of new packages.
</summary><p>
A good starting point to know the basics on `Typescript` is [`typescriptlang.org`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).
</p></details>

<details><summary>One important addition for helping on the development is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
Again, there are several ones, but many of us use <b>Visual Studio Code</b> (<code>VSCode</code>).
</summary><p>
A good starting point to know the basics on `VSCode` is [`code.visualstudio.com`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).
</p></details>

If you need help on installing these elements in your system, we provide a [short tutorial](./installation-tutorial.md).

## Other technologies

**TO BE DEVELOPED**:

# Coding standards and workflow for **GobstonesWeb2**

**TO BE DEVELOPED**

## Notes to write about
About Github flow.
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow
The only exception is that merging of branches is done by the Technical Committee.

Document all your code using [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/overview/), and generate the documentation.

Please follow this conventions for filenames.
 * Names should be descriptive and in english.
 * All lowercase with kebab-case should be used for filenames, with no spaces 
   (Except README, CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE that are all uppercase).
 * Only use CamelCase for classes in TS, not documentation files.

 Kebab case -- or kebab-case -- is a programming variable naming convention where a developer replaces the spaces between words with a dash.
 Programming variable names should be descriptive.

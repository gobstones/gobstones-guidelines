# Governance and flow of communication for **GobstonesWeb2**

Project governance provides direction and defines decision making.
Flow of communication guarantees that all contributors are aware of the latest decisions in the project that may affect them.

## Governance
**Gobstones Project** involves all the aspects of **Gobstones**, including the language, the didactics, and the environments.

Although there is, still, no organized committee, there is a [**Core Group**](./current-core-group.md) of researchers and developers that currently take all major decisions regarding the language and the environments, thus providing direction, defining the metrics for validating impacts to the project, and providing the tools needed to communicate, deliver on requirements, etc.
We expect to be able to have a formal committee at some point.

The **Gobstones Community** is integrated by all researchers, developers, and users interested in **Gobstones**.
You can [join the **Gobstones Community**](http://bit.ly/ComunidadGobstones).

**GobstonesWeb2** is an open source project aimed at providing a new version of the current environment, with a solid architecture that is understandable, maintainable, and extensible.
The **Core Group** is actively engaged in complete a MVP, and all contributions are welcome.

If you are interested in contributing to **GobstonesWeb2**, please understand the flow of communication, and also the standards we use for the development, as described in these [**Guidelines**](../README.md).

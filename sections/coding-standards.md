# Coding standards and workflow for **GobstonesWeb2**

**TO BE DEVELOPED**

## Notes to write about
About Github flow.
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow
The only exception is that merging of branches is done by the Technical Committee.

Document all your code using Typedoc, and generate the documentation.

Please follow this conventions for filenames:
 * Names should be descriptive and be in english
 * All lowercase with kebab-case should be used for filenames, with no spaces 
   (Except README,   CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE that are all uppercase)
 * Only use CamelCase for classes in TS, not documentation files.

 Kebab case -- or kebab-case -- is a programming variable naming convention where a developer replaces the spaces between words with a dash. Programming variable names should be descriptive.

**TO BE DEVELOPED**

## Notes to write about
Please follow this conventions for filenames:
 * Names should be descriptive and be in english
 * All lowercase with kebab-case should be used for filenames, with no spaces 
   (Except README,   CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE that are all uppercase)
 * Only use CamelCase for classes in TS, not documentation files.

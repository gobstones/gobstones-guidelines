# Code standards and workflow for GobstonesWeb2

**TO BE DEVELOPED**

## Notes to write about
About Github flow.
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow
The only exception is that merging of branches is done by the Technical Committee.

Please follow this conventions for filenames:
 * Names should be descriptive and be in english
 * All lowercase with kebab-case should be used for filenames, with no spaces 
   (Except README,   CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE that are all uppercase)
 * Only use CamelCase for classes in TS, not documentation files.

   Kebab case -- or kebab-case -- is a programming variable naming convention 
   where a developer replaces the spaces between words with a dash. Programming 
   variable names should be descriptive.

# Instructions to install a repository, for newcomers

## Installing on **WSL** for use with **VSCode** on **Windows**

This brief tutorial is an explanation for beginners on how to use **VSCode**, using **WSL** on **Windows**. 
You may read about [**VSCode** and **WSL**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) if you are not familiar with them, where a clear explanation of how to install both **VSCode** and **WSL** from scratch is given.

You may test the packaged either using **VSCode** from **Windows** or on a new **WSL** window, but to be able to debug it, it is best to use a new **WSL** window.

Let's go to the installation. Skip any steps that you already performed.

1. Install **VSCode** and **WSL** on your machine.

2. Then you will need to install `Node.js` on **WSL**. 
   For that, run 

    ```sudo apt install npm``` 

   (after updating your `apt` with `sudo apt-get update`, if needed) on a **WSL** terminal. 
   Check the success of installation with `node -v`.

3. As you will also use `Typescript`, you will need to install it as well, by running 

   ```npm install -g typescript```

   Check the success of installation with `tsc -v`.

4. Then clone (or fork) the repository you want to work with. 
   If you are not going to debug, you may use any **Windows** directory, but if you want to debug, you will need to clone on the **WSL** file system (usually `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<username>`).
   The tool to manage `git` repositories is built-in inside WSL, but if you are using **Windows**, you may need to install and configure a [**GIT manager for Windows**](https://gitforwindows.org/).

    **NOTE:** I tried to debug the component from inside **VSCode** running it directly on **Windows**, but I failed, so I went for the conservative approach.

    Remember to follow the guidelines described in [**Coding standards and workflow**](./coding-standards.md) regarding the use of branches and pull-requests if you are going to experiment.

5. The next step is to open **VSCode**, and connect to a remote host to be able to run it inside **WSL**. 
   For that you use the `><` icon on the lower left corner of the window, and select `New WSL Window`. 
   The icon on the lower left corner should change to `>< WSL: Ubuntu`.

6. The following step is to open the package folder using `Open Folder` (either from the `File` menu, the button on the `Explorer`, the link in the `Getting started` window, or by using the keyboard shortcut -- by default, `CTRL-K CTRL-O`).

7. If needed, before proceeding with the final step, you may want to perform an update, running first 
   
   ```npm update```

8. The final step is installing the component, by fetching all the dependencies. 
   For that, open a console (`CTRL-%60`), and run 
   
   ```npm install```

VoilÃ . You are now ready to start exploring the package.
